# UI4AP

Hello, this is a functional but not complete windows application that generates cubic hermite splines. It can do this pretty easily with no problems. The program is bare though.
The UI is not complete, the generation is probably not perfect, and you will need to manually code the points in the program. 

It should be noted that you will need to change the background image as it probably doesn't exist on your computer. It will probably crash otherwise.
The line is "graphImage.loadFromImage(readCVGraph("C:\\Users\\scdel\\Downloads\\57ab4a52fc09d8cf5624b2e7b34e92d5.png", theTexts.timeNumber));" in the main function.
